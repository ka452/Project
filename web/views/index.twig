    <p>New 8th generation Processors by Intel</p>

    <p>Intel Corporation (stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in the Silicon Valley. It is the world's second largest and second highest valued semiconductor chip maker based on revenue after being overtaken by Samsung,[2][3] and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.</p>

    <p>Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore (of Moore's law), and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). The fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate.[4] Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.</p>

    <p>During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.</p>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How this sample app works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This app was deployed to Heroku, either using Git or by using <a href="https://github.com/heroku/php-getting-started">Heroku Button</a> on the repository.</li>

        <li>When Heroku received the source code, it fetched all the dependencies in the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/php-getting-started/blob/master/composer.json">composer.json</a>, creating a deployable slug.</li>
        <li>The platform then spins up a dyno, a lightweight container that provides an isolated environment in which the slug can be mounted and executed.</li>
        <li>You can scale your app, manage it, and deploy over <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/">150 add-on services</a>, from the Dashboard or CLI.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are following the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php">Getting Started</a> guide, then please head back to the tutorial and follow the next steps!</li>
        <li>If you deployed this app by deploying the Heroku Button, then in a command line shell, run:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>git clone https://github.com/heroku/php-getting-started.git</code> - this will create a local copy of the source code for the app</li>
          <li><code>cd php-getting-started</code> - change directory into the local source code repository</li>
          <li><code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;your-app-name></code> - associate the Heroku app with the repository</li>
          <li>You'll now be set up to run the app locally, or <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#push-local-changes">deploy changes</a> to Heroku</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
